Cock and ball torture (CBT), occasionally known as penis torture, dick torture or male genitorture, 
is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. 
This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, 
genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.The recipient of such activities 
may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play 
is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.
